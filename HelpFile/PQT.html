<h3 align="center">Parameterised Query Tool [PQT] v1.5</h3>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
This is a pretty simple SQL query tool with one main objective - to allow you
to parameterise your queries client-side. Also, by associating scripts with a
database via a named folder, you can then launch a query directly from a menu
item and have the tool prompt you for the relevant parameters all in one go.
</p><p>
It was originally written over 10 years ago as a test harness (like all my GUI 
tools) for the ODBC facade in my In-Memory Database Library. Although tools
like TOAD and SSMS are streaks ahead in every other area I still find this tool
invaluable during support as you'll see later on when I discuss how I use it.
</p>

<a name="Connect"></a>
<h5>Opening a Database Connection</h5>

<p>
Before you can execute a query you'll need to open a connection to a database
which is done by the "Database | Connect..." command. Sadly you'll notice that
the list of configured connections is empty so you need to create one first by
clicking the <a href="#Manage">"Manage Databases..."</a> button.
The databases can also be reconfigured later by using the "Database | Manage..."
command.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Once you have configured the database connection you can then select it from
the list and click OK. The Login and Password fields will be disabled unless
you chose a Security Model of "Login" when you configured the databse. PQT
remembers your last five connections so that you can quickly select them from
the MRU list on the "Database" menu.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p>

<a name="Execute"></a>
<h5>Executing Queries</h5>

<p>
As you can see the main view has two tabs - one for the query and another for
the results. The query pane is a simple Notepad style editor window and the
results a classic ListView in report mode. For non-parameterised queries you
can just enter the SQL and select "Execute | Current" to run it. The pane will
automatically switch to the results window where you should see a grid with the
result set.
</p><p>
<img src="Query.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
The "Execute | File..." command is just a shorthand for loading a query via
"Query | Open..." and then invoking "Execute | Current". Configuring a scripts
folder for the database makes this somewhat redundant now as the Execute menu
will be populated automatically with any .SQL extension files, e.g.
</p><p>
<img src="ExecuteMenu.gif" align="top">
</p>

<a name="Results"></a>
<h5>Manipulating the Results</h5>

<p>
As mentioned above the results pane is just a simple grid. The "#" column is
the row number in the result set and the rest is the normal tabular output. If
you want to use the value from a cell or the name of a column in your query you
can just right-click on the cell and you'll be presented with a menu of those
two options.
</p><p>
<img src="Results.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
<img src="ContextMenu.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
If you have a wide result set and want to see a single row in more detail you
can double-click it and the results for just that row will appear in a separate
window that displays one column value per line so large strings are easier to
read. Once again you can right-click to get the "Copy Value/Column Name" menu.
</p><p>
<img src="RowData.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
If you're looking for a value in a large result set there is a "Results | Find..."
command for searching. Use "Results | Find Next" to locate the next match (it
wraps around to the top if it reaches the bottom). Of course you'll find it
much easier if you use the CTRL+F3 & F3 keyboard accelerators.
</p><p>
The results can be persisted either by saving them to a CSV format file using
the "Results | Save..." command or by printing them with "Results | Print".
</p>

<h5>Writing Parameterised Queries</h5>

<p>
Once you have a specific query working it is then easier to think about
generalising it. This is a simple step that just involves replacing any
'variables' with a symbolic name enclosed in the tokens ${ and }, e.g.
</p><pre>
SELECT *
FROM   Customer
WHERE  CustomerID = ${Customer ID}
</pre><p>
Then whenever you run the query you'll be prompted for the values for any
variables like this:-
</p><p>
<img src="Parameters.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
PQT will remember the value for any variables and make that the default the
next time you run <i>any</i> query with the same variable names. Just like in
programming you'll find it better to use more meaningful names (e.g. StartDate
instead of just Date) as you'll carry more default values over from one query
to the next.
</p><p>
A query is not limited to a single variable, you can have as many as you like,
but naturally they have to have unique names. This also means that
you can reference a variable multiple times within the same query to inject its
value into different expressions, e.g.
</p><pre>
WHERE  ${Date} >= StartDate AND ${Date} <= EndDate
</pre><p>
One thing to watch out for is the correct quoting of strings. It's very easy to
replace a string constant (including the quotes) with a variable instead of
just replacing the text within the constant, e.g.
</p><pre>
SELECT *
FROM   Customer
WHERE  CustomerName LIKE '%${Customer Name}%'
</pre>

<a name="Settings"></a>
<h5>Application Settings</h5>

<p>
There are a few application settings accessible via "Tools | Options..." that
affect the results window. The "Min Column Width" and "Max Column Width" values
control how small or big each result column is displayed by default. These stop one
character fields getting lost and mammoth text strings dominating the output.
You can also control what string value is used to represent a NULL value and
whether the ListView grid lines are enabled or not.
</p>
<img src="Options.gif" align="top">

<a name="Manage"></a>
<h5>Managing the Database Connections</h5>

<p>
The "Manage Databases" dialog allows you to configure the data sources you want
to query. Basically the information you enter is what is bundled into the ODBC
connection string. Although it's ODBC based you do not have to configure a User
or System DSN with ODBC Admin as this can be done on-the-fly using the settings
you provide in PQT. The view shows a summary of the currently configured
databases; use the Add, Edit and Delete buttons to administer them.
</p><p>
<img src="Manage.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
The dialog presented when adding a new database or editing an existing one has
a number of fields, some of which are optional. Which fields are mandatory
depends on whether you're going to use an underlying DSN that has been
previously configured in ODBC Admin or not. The alternative is just to configure
the data source directly in PQT (NB: This does not create a DSN).
</p><p>
<img src="Configure.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
Here is a short description of the fields:-
</p><p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Field</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td><td>The logical name for the database, e.g. DEV, TEST</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DSN</td><td>A pre-configured User or System DSN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Driver</td><td>The name of an ODBC driver, e.g. SQL Native Client</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Server</td><td>The hostname of the database server, if remote</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Database</td><td>The name of the actual database</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File</td><td>The name of a database file, if file-system based</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Security</td><td>The security model in use - None, Login, Trusted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Login</td><td>The default login name, if using Login based security</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scripts</td><td>The folder where SQL scripts are stored</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p><p>
Effectively you have two major choices - configure a DSN using the ODBC Admin tool
and then reference it here via the DSN field or full specify the database in
PQT starting with the Driver. With the latter option you're then likely to be
going for a full-on RDBMS (e.g. SQL Server), in which case you supply a Server
and Database, or a file-system based solution (e.g. Access) in which case you
just provide a File.
</p><p>
The "Scripts" folder listed at the end is how you populate the "Execute" menu
with shortcuts. When you save queries you will prompted to save in this folder
by default and what you use for the filename is what is shown in the menu
(excluding the .sql extension) just like your Favourites in IE. Sadly this
version does not support folders as well for grouping queries. If you have
multiple databases for the same system, e.g. DEV, TEST, PROD then you probably
want to point all the Scripts properties to the same folder so that the same
queries will be accessible across all databases.
</p>

<a name="Example"></a>
<h5>How I Use PQT</h5>

<p>
As I said at the beginning, this tool is a far cry from the modern query tools
we use every day, so I thought I would outline how I it use to show why it's
still in my developer/support toolbox.
</p><p>
In the kind of systems I work on a support question often involves digging
around in the database moving from table to table as I chase the issue from its
original request back to the input data for a specific entity. It's very common
to use simple integral values as the primary keys for entities, like customers,
so there tends to be a lot of copy and pasting of numbers from the result set
of one query into the next. And that's where PQT comes in.
</p><p>
I might start with the following report style query to give me an overview of
system health. This would be saved in the Scripts folder as, say, "Report Error
Message Counts.sql":-
</p><pre>
SELECT c.ErrorMessage,
       COUNT(*)
FROM   Calculation c
GROUP  BY c.ErrorMessage
</pre><p>
I may notice that we have a new error or perhaps a rise in the occurrence of an
existing one and I'd like to track down a request that exhibits it so I can
reproduce and fix it. The first step is to right-click on the cell with the
error message and select "Copy Field Value". Then I would click the "Execute"
menu and select another pre-saved query called, say, "Find Calculations with Error.sql".
The query might look something like this:-
</p><pre>
SELECT *
FROM   Calculation c
WHERE  c.ErrorMessage LIKE '%${Error}%'
</pre><p>
From here I would be able to get another ID, this time for the request that
generated the task and I would do the same again, i.e. copying the ID and then
running another pre-saved query, probably called "Find Request by ID.sql". Of
course this example is somewhat contrived as I would really use queries with a
bunch of joins so that I don't need quite so many steps to get at the pertinent
information, but I usually need at least a few scripts to get there.
